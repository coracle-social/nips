Closed Groups
------------------

Some online communities may want a measure of privacy. While nostr's architecture isn't conducive to high levels of privacy due to metadata leakage and the difficulty of implementing ratchets for key rotation, it can provide basic encrypted channels appropriate for use with large groups with dynamic member lists.

This NIP relies on [./86.md](NIP 86) for key sharing.

# Protocol Description

## Group Definition

Groups are identified by the address of a replaceable `kind 35834` event. This may be wrapped using the shared key to support privately-defined groups, or published normally to support a public listing for the private group.

```json
{
  "kind": 35834,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<uuid>"],
    ["name", "<Group name>"],
    ["about", "<Group description>"],
    ["picture", "<Group thumnail>"],
    ["banner", "<Group banner image>"],
    ["relay", "<url>"],
    ["relay", "<url>"]
  ]
}
```

## Admin Key

The key used to publish the group's `kind 35834` definition event MUST be used for performing privileged actions, such as publishing key rotations. Non-administrative events MAY be published to the group by the admin.

Because the admin key is used for managing key rotation, it's recommended that a dedicated key be used for group administration instead of the group admin's personal key.

## Key Sharing

Key sharing and rotation is accomplished as described in [86.md](NIP 86), with the addition to the `kind 24` event of an `a` tag pointing to the group's address. Admins MAY share admin keys with themselves (for use on multiple devices) or with others the same way. In either case, the `role` tag MUST be used to specify whether the key is a `member` key or an `admin` key.

```json
{
  "kind": 24,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "35834:<admin pubkey>:<group name>"],
    ["privkey", "<the private key being shared>"],
    ["relay", "<where to find group messages"],
    ["role", "<member|admin>"]
  ]
}
```

## Access Requests

Anyone may request access to a group using a `kind 25` rumor wrapped with an ephemeral key and addressed to the admin's key. The rumor's `content` MAY include a message, and its `tags` MUST include an `a` tag pointing to the group definition event's address. `tags` MAY also include a `claim` which admins can use to validate the access request, for example an invite code or payment receipt.

On receipt, an admin MAY choose to admit the pubkey either by rotating keys or sharing the most recent shared key.

```json
{
  "kind": 25,
  "content": "Pleeease let me in",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "35834:<admin pubkey>:<group name>"],
    ["claim", "NOSTR2023"]
  ]
}
```

## Exit Requests

Anyone may request to be removed from a group using a `kind 26` rumor wrapped with an ephemeral key and addressed to the admin's key. The rumor's `content` MAY include a message, and its `tags` MUST include an `a` tag pointing to the group definition event's address.

On receipt, an admin SHOULD remove the pubkey by rotating keys.

```json
{
  "kind": 26,
  "content": "I'm outta here",
  "tags": [["a", "35834:<admin pubkey>:<group name>"]]
}
```

## Messages

Any group member MAY post an event to the group either publicly following NIP 72, or privately. Private events MUST be sealed by the user's own key, wrapped by the shared key, and addressed to the shared key. Anyone with the shared key may decrypt these messages.

All messages MUST include an `a` tag (on the rumor if wrapped) pointing to the group definition event's address. Events of any kind MAY be published to the group either publicly or privately.

All events SHOULD be published only to relays specified by the `kind 35834` group definition event.

## Member lists

Admins MAY publish member lists using `kind 27`. This MAY be published as a normal event, or wrapped and sent to the group. An `op` tag indicates whether the listed pubkeys are being `add`ed to the group, `remove`d from the group, or whether the member list is being `set`. An `a` tag MUST be included pointing to the group definition event's address.

```json
{
  "kind": 27,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "35834:<admin pubkey>:<group name>"],
    ["op", "add"],
    ["p", "<pubkey 1>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey 2>"],
  ]
}
```

# Other Notes

## Anonymous membership

To post to a group, you must reveal your public key, doxxing yourself to all other members of a group, all of whom are able in turn to reveal your identity outside the group. To avoid this, users may join groups anonymously by using a keypair separate from their primary key to sign notes. They may then publish an alternative kind0 to the group to maintain a different identity. Clients should help users to manage their alternative key using an appropriate strategy.

## Always-on admin key

There is no need for an admin to be always online, since key rotation requests do not expire. However, for larger groups timely key rotation might be desired. Because an admin key is distinct from that of the group owner(s), it would be easy to create an always-on service that can automate key rotations.
