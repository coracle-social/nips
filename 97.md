NIP-97
======

Read Status
-----------

`draft` `optional`

Clients may wish to track whether certain events have been seen by a user, including mentions, replies, likes, messages, community posts, and more.
Keeping a single timestamp for each category can result in events being missed if they are not fetched successfully on the first attempt. Meanwhile,
tagging every event seen is wasteful and can result in a lot of events being published and downloaded just to maintain a notification badge.

This NIP combines both approaches, by asking clients to set a kind `30115` read status event's `created_at` timestamp to a time in the recent past,
then enumerate events created after that time that have been seen by the user. This results in a small event payload, few events, and granular seen
status for all events since the event's `created_at` time.

A `d` tag is required, denoting the read status category. Any name may be used, but for the sake of interoperability the values below SHOULD be
used when applicable. If multiple categories of events are seen at once, one event should be published for each relevant category.

- `reactions` - reactions to the user's notes
- `reposts` - reposts of the user's notes
- `zaps` - zaps tagging the user
- `follows` - new followers of the current user
- `unfollows` - lost followers of the current user
- `mutes` - new mutes of the current user
- `unmutes` - new mutes of the current user
- `mentions` - other notes tagging the user that aren't replies
- `replies` - replies to user notes
- The `d` tag of a NIP 72 community for tracking posts to that community
- The `d` tag of a NIP 89 closed group for tracking posts to that group
- The id of a NIP 29 group for tracking posts to that group
- The pubkey of the counterparty in a DM conversation
- The conversation id of a NIP 17 group chat (all pubkeys in the chat sorted and joined by a comma)

`e` and `a` tags SHOULD be encrypted using [NIP 44](./44.md) and placed in the read status event's `content` field.
